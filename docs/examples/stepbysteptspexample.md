# Step-by-step example for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with MorK

## What is the Travelling Salesman Problem?

The traveling salesman problem (commonly denoted as TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the
distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and
returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer
science and operations research.

.

## 1. Environment set up

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- Java 11 or more recent is required to run. Please download and install a recent JDK.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- This is not really a prerequisite, but we recommend using an IDE, such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
  ðŸ˜‰. (It's the IDE used in the development of Mork)

> ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Have you ever use SDKMAN to easily manage your JDKs and SDKs?. Have a look to the official *[web page](https://sdkman.io/)*.

### 1.2 Download problem  instances

In order to test the proposed algorithms for the TSP we will use the standard instances for the problem, that can be
easily obtained from *[TSPLIB](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsplib.html)*.
*[TSPLIB](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsplib.html)* is a library of sample instances for the TSP
(and related problems) from various sources and of various types. Particularly, we will use
the *[TSPLIB Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem Instances](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsp/index.html)*
. For the moment, you will only need to download those files ending in *.tsp.

### 1.3 Using the quick start project generator

Go to the *[https://rmartinsanta.github.io/mork/](https://rmartinsanta.github.io/mork/)*, set "TSP" as the Project Name
and generate your project. After less than a minute you will be able to download your project.  
Then, extract the zip file and import it your favorite IDE.


> ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Some IDEs, allow you to select the `pom.xml` file when you select the option to import an existing project. If such a possibility exists, we highly recommend **importing the project as a maven project**. Indeed, most of them have it. Some examples of how to import a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project in the most important editors can be found in: [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-importing.html), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/MavenBestPractices.asciidoc).



For your future project, remember to choose a good name, i.e., check that it starts with an Uppercase letter followed by
any alphanumeric characters or underscores, without spaces.

### 1.4 A quick look

The project is organized in the following folders

- **.run**

If you are using  [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you might have noticed that there are two default
configuration files (located in  `.run` folder): `Performance.run.xml` and `Validation.run.xml`. On the one hand, the
performance run configuration corresponds to a normal execution of the framework. On the other hand, the validation run
configuration has the assertion enables (don't you know what assertion is? Have a look to [Testing in MorK section]()).
In this case, as soon as an assertion is not true, an exception will be thrown. Anyway, to configure your own run
configuration, the main class of Mork is located at `es.urjc.etsii.grafo.TSP.Main`.

- **docker**
- **instances**

This folder should everything related with the instance of the problem. In this case, since we are tackling the TSP,
this folder might contain TSP instances. Therefore, locate the download instances (*.tsp files) at
*[TSPLIB Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem Instances](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsp/index.html)*
in this folder.

- **src/main**: main folders of the procedure 
    - **java/es.urjc.etsii.grafo.TSP**
      - constructives
      - experiments
      - model
    - **resources**

### Testing in MorK

#### Asserts

I'm sure you've spent hours in front of your code trying to find that ðŸ¤¬ bug. For that reason, we consider that it is
important that any operation must be validated, and check that the implemented procedures perform the desired behavior.
And how can this be done in MorK? There are many ways, testing is one way (go to section XXX for an example of Test
implementation in Mork), but in this case, we are talking about **asserts**.

The keyword or reserved word **assert** is used to state that at a certain point in the code a certain condition must be
true. For example, if you write a method that calculates the speed of a particle, you might assert that the calculated
speed is less than the speed of light. Not using it yet? Take a look at
the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html) and start
using it right now. Experience has shown that writing assertions while programming is one of the quickest and most
effective ways to detect and correct bugs. As an added benefit, assertions serve to document the inner workings of your
program, enhancing maintainability. By default, assertions are disabled at runtime. To enable assertions use
the `-enableassertions`, or `-ea`, as a program argument.
