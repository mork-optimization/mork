## A value of 0 silences all debug messages. Higher values provide
## more verbose debug messages.

## Number of iterations of Race. Do not use something else than the
## default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly what
## you are doing.

## to be sampled and evaluated at each iteration. Use
## the default unless you know exactly what you are doing.

## will not use an instance more that once in each race. Note that
## if the number of instances provided is less than firstTest, no
## statistical test will be performed.

## Seed of the random number generator (must be a positive integer, NA
## means use a random seed).

## Number of calls to targetRunner to execute in parallel. Less than 2

# Use an absurdly high number to avoid Irace being the bottleneck.
# Parallelism is automatically controlled by the Mork Execution Controller.

## Enable/disable load-balancing when executing experiments in
## parallel. Load-balancing makes better use of computing resources, but
## increases communication overhead. If this overhead is large, disabling
## load-balancing may be faster.

## Enable/disable SGE cluster mode. Use qstat to wait for
## cluster jobs to finish (targetRunner must invoke qsub).

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute targetRunner in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).

## of the probabilistic model.

## Confidence level for the elimination test.
