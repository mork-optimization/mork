This is not the exact version of the software used in those papers, since
further modifications have been done along the way. Therefore, if something is
not working or you cannot reproduce the results in those papers, please contact
us immediately and we will find out what has changed with respect to older
versions.

Please, if you use this software in any publication, give proper credit to us
by citing the above papers. See the section "License" below for details.


Building
--------

The programming language is C++, and the software has been tested on
GNU/Linux using GCC >= 4.8.

The unpacked sources contain the following directories: libmisc, and beam-aco.
Change the current directory to beam-aco/trunk and invoke `make`. For testing
use:

    $ make DEBUG=1

For final results, use

    $ make DEBUG=0

The objective type can be selected by adding either `OBJECTIVE=TOURCOST` or
`OBJECTIVE=MAKESPAN` to the call to `make`. By default, the code is compiled
for integer values. If your data is real-valued, you need to recompile with
`NUMBER_TYPE=DOUBLE`. For example,

   $ make DEBUG=0 OBJECTIVE=MAKESPAN NUMBER_TYPE=DOUBLE

See the parameters available using:

    $ ./beamaco_tsptw --help
