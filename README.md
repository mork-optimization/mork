## What
Mork is a framework for developing approaches for NP-Hard problems using the JVM. 
It is currently under heavy development.

## Why use it
The idea of the project is to provide both high quality and tested componentes that can be used as is, and a developing framework to create new metaheuristic approaches for different kind of problems. A non extensive list of its current main benefits are:
- Automatic experiment paralelization
- Automatic results report generation
- Guaranteed reproducibility, even in high concurrency environments, by using the provided RandomManager.
- Can execute anywhere (at least, anywhere where Java and Docker can!). Easily build Docker containers that can execute almost anywhere.
- Automatic benchmarking and optional timings adjustment.
- Nice web interface to visualize solution quality and experiment progress.
