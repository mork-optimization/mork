## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## Directory where the programs will be run.

## File to save tuning results as an R dataset, either absolute path
## or relative to execDir.

## A file containing a list of initial configurations.
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# configurationsFile = ""

## The script called for each configuration that launches the program to be
## tuned.  See templates/target-runner.tmpl
targetRunner = "./middleware.sh"

## Number of times to retry a call to target-runner if the call failed.
# targetRunnerRetries = 0

## Optional data passed to targetRunner. This is ignored by the default
## targetRunner function, but it may be used by custom targetRunner functions
## to pass persistent data around.
# targetRunnerData = NULL

## Optional R function to provide custom parallelization of target.runner.  The
## signature of this function should be 'function(experiments, target.runner,
## scenario)', where target.runner is an R function, 'experiments' is a list
## such that each of its elements will be the argument to one call of
## target.runner, and scenario will also be passed to every call. See
## help(target.runner.default) for details.
# targetRunnerParallel = NULL

## Optional script that provides a numeric value for each configuration.
## See templates/target-evaluator.tmpl
# targetEvaluator = ""

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of targetRunner) that will
## performed. It determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning.

## Number of elite configurations returned by irace that will be tested.
# testNbElites = 1

## Enable/disable testing the elite configurations found at each iteration.
# testIterationElites = 0

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 4

## A value of 0 silences all debug messages. Higher values provide
## more verbose debug messages.

## Number of iterations of Race. Do not use something else than the
## default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly what
## you are doing.
# nbIterations = 0

## Number of experiments per iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.

## Sample the instances or take them always in the same order.

## Specifies how many instances are seen between elimination tests.

## iteration. Do not use something else than the default (that is, the

## each iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly

## This value is used to determine the number of configurations
## to be sampled and evaluated at each iteration. Use
## the default unless you know exactly what you are doing.

## Enable/disable deterministic algorithm mode, if enabled irace
## will not use an instance more that once in each race. Note that
## if the number of instances provided is less than firstTest, no
## statistical test will be performed.
# deterministic = 0

## Seed of the random number generator (must be a positive integer, NA
## means use a random seed).
# seed = NA

## Number of calls to targetRunner to execute in parallel. Less than 2
## means calls to targetRunner are sequentially executed.
# parallel = 0

## Enable/disable load-balancing when executing experiments in
## parallel. Load-balancing makes better use of computing resources, but
## increases communication overhead. If this overhead is large, disabling
## load-balancing may be faster.
# loadBalancing = 1

## Enable/disable SGE cluster mode. Use qstat to wait for
## cluster jobs to finish (targetRunner must invoke qsub).
# sgeCluster = 0

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute targetRunner in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).
# mpi = 0

## Enable/disable the soft restart strategy that avoids premature convergence
## of the probabilistic model.
# softRestart = 1

## Confidence level for the elimination test.
# confidence = 0.95

## absolute path or relative to the current directory. If empty or
## NULL, recovery is not performed.

## for any evaluated configuration. If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
forbiddenFile = "./forbidden.txt"

## Enable/disable elitist irace.
# elitist = 1

## Number of instances to add to execution list before previous instances in
## elitist irace.

## elimination of configurations.
