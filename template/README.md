## Datasets

Instances are categorized in different datasets inside the 'instances' folder. All instances are from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or reference to paper where they are from, etc.

### Instance format

(Explain instance format so other users may easily use them even if not using your code.)


## Compiling

You can easily compile and build an executable artifact of this project using Maven and a recent version of Java (17+):
```text
mvn clean package
```

## Executing

Executable artifacts are generated inside the `target` directory. For ease of use, there is an already executable JAR inside the target folder.
To review a full list of configurable parameters, see the `application.yml`, or review the [configuration section of the Mork documentation](https://docs.mork-optimization.com/en/latest/features/config/).

Example 1: execute default experiment with the default set of instances
```text
java -jar target/__RNAME__.jar 
```

Example: execute the IteratedGreedyExperiment using a different set of instances, located inside the `newinstances` folder.
```
java -jar target/__RNAME__.jar --instances.path.default=newinstances --solver.experiment=IteratedGreedyExperiment
```
