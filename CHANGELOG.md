# Developing
- (New) Add support for 7Z and ZIP compressed instances, with no configuration required.
- More coming soon!

# v0.19
- (Fix) Cannot export boolean instance properties to Excel sheets
- (New) Java 21 compatibility. After extended testing, Java 21 will become the minimum required version.
- (New) Autoconfig: /auto/debug/tree display accumulated tree sizes
- (New) Allow usage of Java 21+ preview APIs by default, such as ScopedValues and string templates
- (Fix) Autoconfig: JSON deserialization limit 
- (New) Autoconfig: configurable relationship blocks
- (Breaking) Reorganized Autoconfig classes, reimporting them in existing projects may be necessary if upgrading the Mork version.
- (Fix) Metrics: throw exception during AUC calculation if metric has negative values
- (Fix) Math.random() patch, enable its test
- (New) Metrics: add parameter to optionally calculate natural log of metric AUC.
- (New) Logging: improve default logging configuration
- (New) Add Algorithm::setName to allow changing the algorithm name after creation, util for example for algorithms built by the autoconfig components. In any case, this method should never be called after the algorithm has started.
- (New) AbstractMetric::getReferenceNanoTime to get current reference nano time
- Various small bug fixes and improvements

# v0.18
- (New) Property `solver.max-derivation-repetition` allows restricting algorithms generated from the grammar by 
limiting the number of time any derivation can be applied. Refactor algorithm generator in autoconfig module.
- (New) Instance selector: any Mork executable can now be invoked with the "--instance-selector" switch that will 
generate the necessary data to perform automatic preliminary instances selection.
- (New) Metrics refactor: simplify, modularize and make easy to extend by using the AbstractMetric class.
  Example, adding a new datapoint NOW to the best objective metric, changed from: 
  ```java
  if(scores actually improves best value) {
    Metrics.add(Metrics.BEST_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION, score);
  }
  ```
  to simply
  ```java 
  Metrics.add(BestObjective.class, score);
  ```
  and the metric internally will only add the point if it actually improves the score. To implement any custom metric, 
  just extend the `AbstractMetric` class.
