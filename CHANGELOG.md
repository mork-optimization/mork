# v0.13
- (New) Custom instance properties. See Instance::getProperty and setProperty for more info.
- (Fix) Use reference results in all ResultSerializers instead of only when exporting to XLSX.

# v0.12
- (New) GRASP::afterGRASP: Optionally execute anything after the GRASP constructive finishes
- (New) Verify move changes solution score as expected
- (New) Option to enable/disable instance preload
- (New) Warn if IteratedImproved appears stuck
- (New) Added SolutionValidator to template project by default
- (Refactor) Results Serializers: CSV, XLSX
- (Fix) Workload hard limit 1mk
- (Fix) Benchmark should use seed configured via properties
- (Fix) Missing return in SimulatedAnnealingBuilder method
- (Fix) Export all generated solutions by default if a solution serializer is enabled instead of only best for pair (alg, instance)



# v0.11
- (New) Swap methods in ArrayUtil
- (New) Events: AlgorithmProcessingStartedEvent, AlgorithmProcessingEndedEvent
- (Improvement) AbstractExperiment now requires SolverConfig instead of a "strange" boolean value.
- (Improvement) IteratedGreedy
- (Improvement) SimulatedAnnealing: Customizable Acceptance Criteria
- (Improvement) Irace: return both objetive function and elapsed time.
- (Fix) Run configurations in template project
- (Fix) Disable websockets logging by default
- (Fix) Excel logger gave the impression to be stuck
- (Fix) Potential classpath conflict with JSONObject
- (Docs) Events and result export / solution serialization

# v0.10
Mainly internal changes, refactored some critical components
- (New) Refactor Executors: ConcurrentExecutor can be as much as 8 times faster for certain workloads.
- (New) Refactor solutions serializers: Easily extend and customize how solutions should be exported to disk. Disable or keep default JSON serializer.
- (New) Refactor results serializers: New features, the most prominent one now they can export after solving each instance to provide instant feedback instead of waiting until the whole experiment ends.
- (New) Added TSP example and documentation.
- (New) Detect in some cases when user does not update TTB and throw exception.
- (Fix) Added missing irace file during project generation via web.
- (Fix) Irace logs were not included in log files.
- (Fix) Irace middleware.sh now works properly in Mac.
- (Fix) Max length for algorithms short names, throws exception before experiment starts if any algorithm is longer.

# v0.9
- (Fix) PatchMathRandom and PatchCollections for Java 11 and newer.
- (New) MultiStartAlgorithm
- (New) Simulated Annealing
- (New) Customizable random implementations. RandomManager::getRandom now returns an instance of RandomGenerator.
- (Deprecated) SimpleMultiStartAlgorithm
- Java 17 as minimum required version
- Replaced Solution::getBetterSolution with Solution::isBetterThan
- Better generic usage in Solution --> Solution<Self,Instance>
- (NEW) Easily create Docker containers

# v0.8
- Internal Maven changes

# v0.7
- Changed ReferenceResultProvider, now multiple instances can be provided in order to automatically compare against several approaches.
- Improved Excel serializer: Configurable metrics in pivot table, better generation in raw table. All calculated values are not generated by Excel.
- Fixed several bugs and other minor improvements

# v0.6
- Irace integration, see Wiki for more details.
- Algorithm::getBuilder: get current SolutionBuilder.
- Two types of neighborhoods, normal and lazy. Lazy generated movements under demand, while eager returns a collection of movements.
- New event type: ErrorEvent, when an unhandled exception is propagated inside an Executor.
- Telegram bot, if enabled, sends message onErrorEvent.

# v0.5
- Added Telegram integration, see Wiki for more information and how to use.
- Fixed bug in IteratedGreedy
- Added option to allow users to decide if the backend should stop and the application be killed after all experiments are finished.
